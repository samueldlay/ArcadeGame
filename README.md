# Welcome to _A Strange Game That Resembles Frogger_!

### Author: Samuel Lay

## How to Play:
- In this game, you must cross the enemy line to the cleansing waters of freedom
- (The enemy trying to capture you shares a striking resemblance with Donald Trump)
- Navigate by using the directional arrows on the keyboard (Up, Right, Down, and Left)
- Every time you cross over to the cleansing waters, your score increases
- If the enemy captures you:
  - Your position is reset to the original coordinates
  - The enemy increases by 1
- __You may have some difficulty achieving a score past 7__
 - There is a cheat code for attaining a much higher score, however. Try to figure it out!!!
